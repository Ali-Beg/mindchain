# MindChain Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the MindChain framework, highlighting planned features and improvements.

## Current Version (0.1.7)

- ✅ Initial implementation of the Master Control Program (MCP)
- ✅ Basic Agent implementation with simulated responses
- ✅ Simple memory management system
- ✅ Policy enforcement through the PolicyManager
- ✅ Resource management and tracking
- ✅ Basic demo script showing single and multi-agent capabilities

## Next Immediate Steps

- [ ] Real LLM integration with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- [ ] Vector database integration for improved memory retrieval
- [ ] Basic tool implementation (web search, code execution, etc.)
- [ ] Package publishing preparation (Poetry setup)

## Short-term Goals (0.2.0)

- [ ] Enhanced memory system with hierarchical structure
- [ ] Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Extended tool ecosystem with common utilities
- [ ] Basic web interface for agent monitoring
- [ ] Improved MCP policy enforcement
- [ ] Testing suite expansion

## Mid-term Goals (0.3.0 - 0.5.0)

- [ ] Advanced multi-agent orchestration capabilities
- [ ] Agent specialization and role-based collaboration
- [ ] Self-improvement loops for agents
- [ ] Complex task decomposition strategies
- [ ] Performance optimization for reduced token usage
- [ ] Integration with popular vector databases
- [ ] Visual builder for agent configuration

## Long-term Goals (1.0.0+)

- [ ] Enterprise-grade security features
- [ ] Distributed MCP for large-scale agent management
- [ ] Advanced learning capabilities for agents
- [ ] Comprehensive benchmarking suite
- [ ] Integration with specialized models for different tasks
- [ ] Agent marketplaces for sharing and discovery
- [ ] Complex simulation environments for agent training
- [ ] Edge deployment support for privacy-sensitive applications

## Areas of Research

- Agent cognition and meta-reasoning
- Human-AI collaboration patterns
- Multi-agent negotiation protocols
- Ethical frameworks for agent behavior
- Memory consolidation strategies
- Efficient context management
- Specialized vs. generalist agent architectures

## Community Initiatives

- [ ] Establish governance structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- [ ] Develop evaluation metrics for agent performance
- [ ] Build public benchmarks for agent capabilities
- [ ] Organize community events and challenges
